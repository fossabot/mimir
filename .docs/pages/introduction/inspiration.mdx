# Inspiration

Mímir (both in concept and general architecture) is heavily inspired by [Elan Ruskin's amazing session from GDC 2012 on AI-driven Dynamic Dialog][gdc]:

Fundamentally speaking, Mímir is simply a Rust implementation of Elan's proposed system for dynamic dialog. However, Mímir does offer some differences and/or extensions that cater specifically to games developed internally at Subtale.
