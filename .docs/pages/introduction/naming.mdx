# Why Mímir?

Internally at Subtale, we've adopted a naming convention around Norse mythology for tools, packages, and working titles for games.

Quoting from [norse-mythology.org][mimir]:

> Mímir is an exceptionally wise being and a counselor of the gods.

We hope that this contextual query engine lives up to its name in being just as wise about your game's state and defined behaviours!

<Callout type="info">
    Acknowledging a happy coincidence in the naming of Mímir, we love all of the work done by the folks over at [Santa Monica Studio][sms] (especially on 2018's reboot of God of War)!
