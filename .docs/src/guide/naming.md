# Why Mímir?

Internally at Subtale, we've adopted a naming convention around Norse mythology for tools/packages/systems and working titles for games.

Quoting from [norse-mythology.org][mimir], Mímir is an exceptionally wise being and a counselor of the gods. We hope that this contextual query engine lives up to its name in being just as wise about your game's state and defined behaviours!

::: tip P.S.
Acknowledging a happy coincidence, we love all of the work done by the folks over at [Santa Monica Studio][sms] (especially on 2018's reboot of God of War)!
